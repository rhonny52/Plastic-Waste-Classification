# Week-1
This repository contains a simple Python script that loads a dataset and creates a pie chart to visualize the distribution of categories (e.g., "Organic" and "Recyclable") within a dataset. Using the pandas library, the script counts occurrences of each category and displays the results as a pie chart using matplotlib.
