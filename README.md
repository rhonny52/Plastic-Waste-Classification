Project Overview
Plastic waste management continues to be a global challenge. This project seeks to address the problem of waste sorting by utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can automatically classify plastic waste. By harnessing the power of deep learning, the model aims to assist in recycling efforts, reduce waste contamination, and improve segregation.

# Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is Waste Classification Data by Sashaank Sekar, featuring images of various plastic waste items. This dataset is designed to train AI models on sorting plastic into predefined categoriesâ€”Organic and Recyclable.

# Dataset Breakdown:
Total Images: 25,077
Training Set: 22,564 images (85% of total dataset)
Test Set: 2,513 images (15%)
Classes: Organic and Recyclable
The goal of utilizing this dataset is to build an intelligent system capable of classifying plastic waste, ultimately contributing to environmental sustainability.

# Key Approach:
Analyzing existing waste management approaches.
Using machine learning techniques to classify images of plastic waste.
Experimenting with various model architectures and techniques for best performance.
Dataset Access Link

# Model Design
The architecture of the CNN follows standard principles for feature extraction, pattern recognition, and image classification:

Convolutional Layers: Detect low-level patterns (edges, textures).
Pooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions and retain important features.
Fully Connected Layers: Map high-level features to class probabilities.
Activation Functions: ReLU (hidden layers) and Softmax (output layer)
Visual representation of the CNN structure is as follows:

# Training Configuration
The following settings are used during model training:

Optimizer: Adam, for adaptive learning rate control.
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy (for multi-class classification).
Training Epochs: Can be adjusted; default is set to 25.
Batch Size: Configurable; default value is 32.
Training involved using techniques such as data augmentation to increase model generalization and avoid overfitting.
